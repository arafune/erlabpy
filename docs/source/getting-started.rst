Installing
==========

The recommended way to install ERLabPy is via `conda
<https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`_. If you do not have conda installed, follow
the :ref:`installation instructions <Installing conda>`. Once you have a working
conda environment, you can install ERLabPy with the conda command line tool: ::

  conda install -c conda-forge erlab

.. hint::

  If you are using macOS, you might experience degraded performance with the
  default BLAS and LAPACK libraries. For Apple Silicon macs, use `Accelerate
  <https://developer.apple.com/accelerate/>`_: ::

    conda install "libblas=*=*accelerate"

  For Intel macs, use `MKL
  <https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/onemkl.html>`_:
  ::

    conda install "libblas=*=mkl"

  To prevent conda from switching back to the default libraries, see the
  `conda-forge documentation
  <https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base/#switching-blas-implementation>`_.

If you donâ€™t use conda, you can install ERLabPy with pip: ::

  pip install erlab
